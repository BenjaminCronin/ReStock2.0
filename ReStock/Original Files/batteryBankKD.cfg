description = AeroKerbin's engineers have completed what may be their most useful upscaled component for Kerbodyne Kompatability. Leveraging supplies of surplus power cells purchased from the dumpsters behind Zaltonic Electronics, they've assembled tested and mostly certified larger diameter batteries with 1000 more units of electric charge than the Z-4K. Negotiations to form an official joint venture as ZaltAero Power are ongoing.
