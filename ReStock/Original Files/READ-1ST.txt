For the Large and Small drop tanks, the Flip Fantasia Airliner Wing and ThunderMax Interstage adapter to work, you must COPY four stock part files to these locations.

Copy mk1fuselage.mu and mk1fuselageFuel.mbm from

Gamedata\Squad\Parts\MK1

to

Gamedata\ReStock\parts\MK1\mk1fuselage

Copy mk1structural.mu and mk1fuselage.mbm from

Gamedata\Squad\Parts\MK1

to

Gamedata\ReStock\parts\MK1\mk1structural

Since Squad has put several parts into a single folder, this is the only way I've been able to get these components to load in KSP.
