description = Ideally, designed for 4 Kerbodybe-sized engines and 4 smaller gimballing engines plus one Rockomax size engine in the middle in close quarters. Includes built-in torque support at a lot of extra weight. The engineers (and janitors) at every other aerospace firm on Kerbin had the same thing to say about this component, but what they said is mostly un-mentionable in polite company.
