IMPORTANT INFORMATION

For the Large and Small drop tanks, the Flip Fantasia Airliner Wing and ThunderMax Interstage adapter to work, you must COPY four stock part files to these locations.

Copy mk1fuselage.mu and mk1fuselageFuel.mbm from

Gamedata\Squad\Parts\MK1

to

Gamedata\ReStock\parts\MK1\mk1fuselage

Copy mk1structural.mu and mk1fuselage.mbm from

Gamedata\Squad\Parts\MK1

to

Gamedata\ReStock\parts\MK1\mk1structural

Since Squad has put several parts into a single folder, this is the only way I've been able to get these components to load in KSP.
------------------------------------------------------

Installs configs. Un-Rar to the GameData folder.

These files use Squad's textures and modules to make new stuff.  Some things are resizes, most are re-combobulations.

Galane's releases.

I haven't been keeping track of dates. When Squad changed a lot of the paths to parts and names of .cfg files, I updated ReStock for .23.x, .24.x and again for .90, renaming it ReStock Reloaded then ReStock Ninety.

I have also added several parts to add more ways to use the stock Kerbodyne parts and added the insanely huge ThunderMaximus tanks and some parts to connect them in interesting ways.

A few example rockets are included using some of the ReStock parts. Move them to the VAB folder in one of your saves. They have the AR202 from MechJeb on them. If you don't use MechJeb you'll need to temporarily install its DLL and the AR202 part to load the example rockets for removing the AR202.
